# Funding Scraper

The `Funding Scraper` project is a Python-based web scraping tool and pipeline developed to extract funding programs from the [Förderdatenbank website](https://www.foerderdatenbank.de/FDB/DE/Home/home.html) of the BMWE. 

## Data

The data contains data for each individual funding program that has been listed on foerderdatenbank.de since June 19th 2025 (the first run of the pipeline). It also includes programs that were once listed but are now deleted. 
Data should be updated automatically every two days between 2am and 3am (cron syntax: `0 2 */2 * *`). However, due to changes in data structure on foerderdatenbank.de beyond our control that can break the scraper, we cannot guarantee that data is always up-to-date. You can check when the data was last updated by downloading the csv zip file and checking the `Date modified` of the csv file. 

The data are stored as `.parquet` and `.csv` files, which can be downloaded via the following links:

- **[Link to parquet data](https://foerderdatenbankdump.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/data/parquet_data.zip)** -> this file contains all available columns and information
- **[Link to csv data](https://foerderdatenbankdump.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/data/csv_data.zip)** -> due to limitations of the csv format, this file does not include all available columns and list and struct data were converted to string.


The data contains columns containing the the information for each funding program ("Förderprogramm") that is available on its individual detail page. 

The columns are defined and further explained in the file [`funding_crawler/models.py`](https://github.com/CorrelAid/cdl_funding_scraper/blob/main/funding_crawler/models.py). 

In addition to those columns, the data contain additional meta columns:

- `on_website_from`: date when the funding program first appeared in the dataset
- `last_updated`: date when the funding program was last updated
- `previous_update_dates:`: list of dates when the funding program was previously updated 
- `offline`: date when the funding program was not on the website anymore

Dates correspond to the date of the pipeline run when changes were detected.

We refer to the [imprint of foerderdatenbank.de](https://www.foerderdatenbank.de/FDB/DE/Meta/Impressum/impressum.html) of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy which indicates [CC BY-ND 3.0 DE](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/3.0/de/deed.de) as the license for all texts of the website.

## Functionality

- In this project, [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) serves as the input for [dlt](https://dlthub.com/). A Scrapy spider iterates over all pages of the funding program overview and extracts data from the respective detail page of each funding program.

- Global settings for scraping, such as scraping frequency and parallelism, can be found and adjusted in the `scrapy_settings.py` file.

- To identify funding programs over the long term, a hash is calculated from the URL.

- Since the website does not provide information on the update or creation date, the [scd2 strategy](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/incremental-loading#scd2-strategy) was chosen for updating the dataset.
    - All funding programs are always scraped.
    - A checksum is calculated from certain fields of a program, which is compared with already existing programs matched by an ID. In case of a discrepancy, the data point is updated, and a value is added to a column that records update dates.
    - New funding programs are added to the dataset.
    - Funding programs that are no longer on the website are retained in the dataset, but the date of their removal, or the last scraping date, is recorded.

- The output from DLT is stored in a serverless Postgres database ([Neon](https://neon.tech/)) and transformed using a query (the DLT output contains one entry per update), so that in the end, there is one row per program.

- The pipeline is orchestrated and operated with [Modal](https://modal.com/). It runs every two days at 2 AM (UTC).

- The Output is saved in a S3 bucket, that can be downloaded and loaded as demonstrated in `load_example.py`.

## Development Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CorrelAid/cdl_funding_scraper.git
   cd cdl_funding_scraper
   ```

2. **Install uv:**

   Follow [these instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

3. **Install Python Requirements:**

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

4. **Set Up Pre-commit:**

   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

5. To access modal, the serverless database and DigitalOcean, where the final dataset is uploaded to, either ask a CorrelAid admin for the credentials or use your own infrastructure by exporting the following environment variabels:
    ```
     export DESTINATION__FILESYSTEM__CREDENTIALS__AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
     export DESTINATION__FILESYSTEM__CREDENTIALS__AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
     export DESTINATION__FILESYSTEM__CREDENTIALS__ENDPOINT_URL=""
     export POSTGRES_CONN_STR="postgresql://....."
    ##### Make sure this does not end up in your shell history
    ```
## Redeploy pipeline
Requires the env vars to be set described above:

```
uv run modal deploy main.py
```

## Tests
This repository contains a limited number of tests.
You can run a spcific test with:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_spider.py -s -vv
```
